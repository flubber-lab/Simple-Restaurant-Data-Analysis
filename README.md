# Simple-Restaurant-Data-Analysis

**Overview**

This project performs a simple analysis on a dataset of restaurants to extract meaningful insights such as identifying the restaurants with the highest ratings, analyzing the distribution of ratings across restaurant types, and more. The dataset provides information on various restaurant characteristics, which are explored and visualized to better understand the landscape of the restaurant industry.

**Dataset**

The analysis is based on the dataset provided, which contains the following key columns:

**Restaurant Name:** The name of the restaurant.

**Type of Restaurant:** The category/type of the restaurant.

**Ratings:** The rating given to the restaurant (numerical values).

**Other Features:** Additional attributes relevant to restaurants.

**Analysis**

The primary goals of this analysis include:

**Highest Rated Restaurants:**

Identified the top-rated restaurants from the dataset.

**Distribution of Ratings:**

Visualized the spread of ratings to understand overall quality trends.

**Type of Restaurant Analysis:**

Analyzed the types of restaurants receiving the best ratings.

**Tools and Libraries Used**

**Python:** The primary programming language used for the analysis.

**Libraries:**

**pandas:** For data manipulation and cleaning.

**matplotlib and seaborn:** For data visualization.

**How to Run the Code**

**Clone the repository:**

git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_folder>

**Install the required Python libraries:**

pip install -r requirements.txt

**Run the analysis script:**

python analysis.py

**Results**

The following insights were obtained from the analysis:

**Top Restaurants:** The dataset revealed the highest-rated restaurants.

**Type-based Trends:** Certain types of restaurants consistently performed better in ratings.

****Visualizations****

Several visualizations were created to summarize the findings, including:

Countplots to show the distribution of restaurant types.

Bar plots for the highest-rated restaurants.

Heatmaps to analyze location-based rating trends.

**Future Work**

Potential improvements to this project include:

Incorporating additional datasets for deeper insights.

Applying machine learning models to predict restaurant ratings.

Analyzing trends over time if temporal data is available.
